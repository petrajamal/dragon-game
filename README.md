# dragon-game

Note: The GitHub repo contains 3 python files

button.py: button module used
battle_ml_model.py: complete python code with machine learning model. This code faced some issues during testing and at the beginning, we were able to open the game, however, after some modifications, it stopped working.
battle_phase_1.py: after facing issues with the ML model, we created a second file without it, to be able to show you the fully functioning game.
